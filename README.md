## Wins

* Deepened grasp of CSS and HTML fundamentals
* Able to fix code after having it break too many times to count, even when I had not changed anything :P

## Challenges + Improvements

* CSS code is held together strictly with duct tape and paper clips; everything was slowly and manually coaxed into position. However, I feel that I'm beginning to get a decent grip on what CSS expects/needs from me
* Need to do more learning on how positioning of elements in HTML affects how CSS interacts with it
* Neglected to observe proper git workflow, which caused otherwise avoidable issues and wasted precious time
